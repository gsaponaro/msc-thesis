explanation of what is here. 

* baltaKin: porting of Ugo's iKin for Baltazar. To be completed
* baltaKinArmCtrl: ditto
* camshift: my implementation of CAMSHIFT, with an ini file and sending coordinates to a YARP port
* graspingWithPF: a simplified version of "reaching", to be used with Matteo's Particle Filter
* reaching: a program that receives reconstructed coordinates of the target then moves Baltazar's arm
* reconstruction: my 3D reconstruction program (requires 2 CAMSHIFT to be running)
